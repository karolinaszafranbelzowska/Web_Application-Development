      In 1973, Fred Byrne took control of the company as his father served his prison sentence. Fred had much of his father in him and was a shrewd business man at the young age of 19. Deciding to focus on the 
      legimate section of the business he continued to sell clothes in the Smithfield market stall, growing the business until he could finally open his first shop on O'Connell street in 1979. People flocked to the new store
      drawn in by the high quality of the merchandise and the low prices of the goods. On release from prison in 1980, Frankie returned to the helm deciding to expand the business further. Three more inner city shops were opened 
      by the end of the decade.

    <p>As the 1990s dawned, there was an explosion in retail in suburban shopping centers and <i>The Clothes Line</i> (as we were now known), expanded further into these centers. At this time our workforce grew exponentially peaking in 1999 at 350. 
    As the internet age dawned, the Byrnes decided to open a webshop to support the core retail business. Slow at first, people eventually became more comfortable shopping online with us until in 2010 our online shop outsold our retail premeises for the first time in our history.</p>
    <p>Frankie died in 2012, just as the brick-and-mortar retail spaces began to decline rapidly. By 2018, all of the retails stores were closed, but a thriving online business is still going strong, headed up by a a third generation of the Byrne Family. Frankie's son Fred, (now in his 60s) still works the Smithfield stall where he describes business as 'OK'.</p><br>
